Experience Vs Gambles
=====
The repository contains source code for modeling decision making under risk using fMRI data.  We provide instructions for 
installation of required packages and commands to run the SVM classifier and an LSTM-CRF model that takes fMRI data as input
and predict choices made by participants. Please read the [report](https://github.com/chinmaib/CSC585/blob/master/report.pdf) 
for more details on the experiment, data, models, and results.

# Data
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data consists of temporal values of intensities ranging from 0-800
extracted at every [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) in the [Hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus) region of the brain for a period of 20 seconds. The temporal resolution of
functional data is 1 second and spatial resolution is 2.5mm x 2.5mm x 2.9mm.
Every participant makes 10 choices- 5 songs (Experiences) and 5 games (Gambles), wherein each choice they 
were asked to select between a risky (high-variance) choice and a safe (low-variance) choice.
