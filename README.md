Experience Vs Gambles
=====
The repository contains source code for modeling decision making under risk using fMRI data. 
We provide instructions for installation of required packages and commands to run the 
SVM classifier and an LSTM-CRF model that take fMRI data as input and predict choices made 
by participants. Please read the [report] for more details about the task.
